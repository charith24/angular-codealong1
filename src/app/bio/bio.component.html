    <h2>CHARITH</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate Engineer with a degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering.My very first
      experience
      with code was at the time when I started my own blog.My struggle to customize the blog pages introduced
      me
      to HTML & CSS.Sooner,the excitement of having the power to structured pages on my own sounded mazing and
      thats when i decided to purchase web development.
      <span class="break"></span>
      but i was really intrested in full stack development program with face.I was knowledge of HTML,CSS and
      JAVASCRIPT,JAVA,C++ and datastructures.Rational thought process and goal-oriented planning are my
      Strengths.
      <span class="break"></span>

      iam currently on the look out of a challenging role to build products that make a difference.</p>
